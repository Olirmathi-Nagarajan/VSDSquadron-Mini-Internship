TASK 1

# Writing a C code to count sum of numbers from 1 to n.

1. First, I opened the terminal and wrote code to create and open a new C file in Leaf pad,
as demonstrated below:

2. Next, I wrote my code in Leaf pad as illustrated below :

3. Then I compiled and ran it in the terminal to verify, and achieved the desired
output.

4. Then I tested different values of n, such as n=100, and obtained the results.


# Running above program in RISC-V Simulator
After running the code in the terminal, I need to execute it in the RISC-V simulator. For this,
a specific set of code is required, which I have implemented in the following steps.:

1) First, I wrote code to compile it with the RISC-V GCC compiler using option 1, which
generates a file with a .o extension.

2) With the command `riscv-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o` to obtain the assembly
code for the above C program. This generated numerous assembly instructions, which
I filtered by appending `| less` to the command. To locate the main section, I searched
for "main." The byte address for main was found to be 10184, and there were 15
instructions when using option 1. It was observed that the address of each consecutive
instruction increments by 4.

3) Next, I ran the same commands but used the `-Ofast` option instead of `-O1`. This
time, I got fewer instructions, specifically 12. This demonstrates that the assembly
instructions in the file change based on the different compilation options used.

TASK 2

RISC V RISC stands for reduced instruction set computer.It is a 32 bit instruction set.It has various instructions some of the basic and important instructions are R,I,S,B,J.

RISCV has following 5 stages

1)Fetch 2)Decode 3)Execute 4)Memory 5)Writeback

Different Type of Instruction Sets:

1. R-type
2. I-type
3. S-type
4. B-type
5. U-type
6. Jtype

# R-type 
*Used for arithmetic and logical instructions.
*Format: opcode [6:0] | rd [11:7] | funct3 [14:12] | rs1 [19:15] | rs2 [24:20] | funct7 [31:25]
*Example: add x1, x2, x3 (adds the values in registers x2 and x3, and stores the result in x1)
opcode: 0110011
funct7: 0000000
rs2: 00011 (x3)
rs1: 00010 (x2)
funct3: 000
rd: 00001 (x1)

# I-type (Immediate)
*Used for arithmetic instructions with immediate values, load instructions, and some system instructions.
*Format: opcode [6:0] | rd [11:7] | funct3 [14:12] | rs1 [19:15] | imm [31:20]
*Example: addi x1, x2, 10 (adds the value in register x2 with the immediate value 10, and stores the result in x1)
opcode: 0010011
imm: 000000001010 (10)
rs1: 00010 (x2)
funct3: 000
rd: 00001 (x1)

# S-type (Store)
*Used for store instructions.
*Format: opcode [6:0] | imm[4:0] [11:7] | funct3 [14:12] | rs1 [19:15] | rs2 [24:20] | imm[11:5] [31:25]
*Example: sw x1, 8(x2) (stores the value in register x1 into the memory address computed as x2 + 8)

imm[4:0]: 01000 (8)
rs2: 00001 (x1)
rs1: 00010 (x2)
